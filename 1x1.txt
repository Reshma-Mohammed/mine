As a follow up from the last call, i have added links to all the video on Data Review Wiki Teams channel. 

Since clarity on Spread Change related process is taking some time, i wanted to understand if we can go ahead and work on the next video. this will be the first video of Non-Actionable transaction.So the review process will be a bit different than usual. So we wanted to ensure that the script is acuurate and is as expected. 

  My work in this and next week:
  
  - Awaiting feedback on the PIK script. Once available will update the PIK video 
  - Review of Rollover script
  - Mockups of BNP, CIB
  - Internal articles for Data view Navigation changes
  - New articles for Tax form Validation
  - Asset Management migration work
